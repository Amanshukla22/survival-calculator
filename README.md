# About
This is a simple Python project that calculates how long you’ve survived based
on the number of days you input. It converts your days into various time units 
like hours, minutes, seconds, weeks, months, and years.

# Features
Converts days into hours, minutes, seconds, weeks, months, and years.
Handles invalid input and shows helpful error messages if something goes wrong.


# My Thought Process
This project was built to show how Python can be used for basic time calculations.
I kept things simple and modular so it can be easily updated later if needed.
It’s a great starting point for learning how to handle user input and convert between different time units.
